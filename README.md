# Customer-Segmentation
Creating a customer segmentation model using RFM analysis done in MS Excel, Tableau and SQL
RFM(Recency,Frequency,Monetary) analysis helps a company to know their best customers, which customers can be retained, which customers contribute to churn rate etc.
Using business data, we use Tableau desktop software to analyse and evalute RFM values for each distinct customer and store such info in an Excel file.
Using this Excel file, we calculate the RFM scores for each customer in the data.
We display the customers with a high RFM scores and low  RFM scores.

Using SQL, we evaluate and analyse the RFM values for individual customers in a business data.
